Thank you for your interest in contributing to the HackMerlin Agent project! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features
- Provide detailed information about the problem
- Include steps to reproduce the issue
- Attach relevant logs or screenshots

### Submitting Changes
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests if applicable
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Chrome browser
- OpenAI API key

### Setup
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hackmerlin-agent.git
cd hackmerlin-agent

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

## üìù Code Style

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused

### Example
```python
def extract_password(self, level: int, response: str, merlin_prompt: str = None) -> str:
    """
    Extract password from Merlin's response using appropriate strategy.
    
    Args:
        level: Current game level (1-7)
        response: Merlin's response text
        merlin_prompt: Original prompt sent to Merlin
        
    Returns:
        Extracted password or None if extraction failed
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=.

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_extractor.py
```

### Writing Tests
- Create test files in the `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, web requests)

### Example Test
```python
import pytest
from llm_extractor import PasswordExtractor

def test_rule_based_extraction_level_1():
    extractor = PasswordExtractor()
    response = 'The password is "SECRET"'
    result = extractor.rule_based(1, response)
    assert result == "SECRET"
```
