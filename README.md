# HackMerlin Autonomous Agent

An intelligent web automation agent designed to play the puzzle game [hackmerlin.io](https://hackmerlin.io/) autonomously using Selenium WebDriver and OpenAI's GPT-4 for password extraction.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements an autonomous agent that can navigate through the HackMerlin puzzle game, interact with Merlin (the game's AI), extract passwords from responses, and progress through multiple levels. The agent combines rule-based extraction with AI-powered fallback mechanisms to solve various puzzle types.

## üöÄ Features

- **Web Automation**: Selenium-based browser automation for reliable interaction
- **Intelligent Password Extraction**: Hybrid approach using rule-based logic and AI
- **Multi-Level Support**: Handles 7 different puzzle types with specialized strategies
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanisms and fallback strategies
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure API key management

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Chrome browser
- OpenAI API key

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivramSriramulu/HackmerlinSpearbit.git
   cd HackmerlinSpearbit
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your OpenAI API key
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

4. **Run the agent**
   ```bash
   python working_agent.py
   ```

## üéÆ How It Works

### Level-Specific Strategies

| Level | Prompt | Strategy | Extraction Method |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | "Password" | Direct extraction | Quoted words, uppercase words |
| 2-3 | "Password in reverse" | Reverse + correct | Reverse letters, AI correction |
| 4-5 | "Acrostic Poem" | First letter acrostic | AI extraction from poem lines |
| 6 | "Acrostic Poem" | First letter acrostic | AI extraction from poem lines |
| 7 | Complex prompts | Last word acrostic | AI extraction from last words |

### Architecture

1. **WebDriver Setup**: Initializes Chrome with optimized settings
2. **Navigation**: Loads hackmerlin.io and waits for React app
3. **Level Solving Loop**:
   - Get appropriate prompt for current level
   - Send prompt to Merlin via chat interface
   - Extract Merlin's response
   - Use rule-based or AI extraction to get password
   - Submit password and handle result
   - Progress to next level

## üìä Performance Results

### Current Success Rate: 71.4% (5/7 levels)

- ‚úÖ **Level 1**: Direct password extraction
- ‚úÖ **Level 2**: Reverse word with AI correction
- ‚úÖ **Level 3**: Reverse word with AI correction  
- ‚úÖ **Level 4**: Acrostic poem extraction
- ‚úÖ **Level 5**: Acrostic poem extraction
- ‚ùå **Level 6**: Acrostic extraction (needs improvement)
- ‚ùå **Level 7**: Last word acrostic (not reached consistently)

## ü§î Analysis & Reflection

### If cost and compute requirements were not an issue, how would you improve the agent?

**1. Advanced AI Models**
- Use GPT-4 Turbo with higher context windows for better understanding
- Implement Claude-3 Opus for superior reasoning capabilities
- Fine-tune models specifically on puzzle-solving tasks

**2. Multi-Modal Capabilities**
- Add computer vision to analyze visual elements
- Implement OCR for text extraction from images
- Use image recognition for pattern detection

**3. Enhanced Reasoning**
- Implement chain-of-thought prompting for complex puzzles
- Add self-reflection mechanisms to verify solutions
- Use multiple AI models in parallel for consensus

**4. Advanced Web Automation**

- Required robust element selection strategies
- Needed to handle dynamic content loading

**2. Puzzle Variety**
- Each level required different extraction strategies
- Some puzzles had ambiguous solutions
- Level 7's "last word" acrostic was particularly challenging

**3. AI Prompt Engineering**
- Crafting effective prompts for different puzzle types
- Balancing specificity with flexibility
- Handling edge cases in AI responses
